# Towards a pattern language for visualizing AI

This is an attempt to start cataloging design patterns for visualizing AI. These patterns are introduced in [these talk slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h8pubQ4v8cZelU72wvAjvg4566rxa0p93U6eQ9x_OmU/edit#slide=id.p). The goal of this document is to add to the language and enrich the patterns with more detailed information and examples. Pull requests welcome!

## Why a pattern language?
TBD (summarize introduction from talk on design & development challenges)

## Content
These patterns are concerned with representing concepts that show up repeatedly in AI.

## Context
These patterns are concerned with clarifying our communication. Keep in mind that all of the patterns in this category work just as well in static media like PDFs. It is still important to call them out explicitly because when they are combined with the patterns in the Choice categories it opens up a whole new world of possibilities.

## Choice
The differentiating patterns of dynamic media are about giving readers a choice. 

## Environment
These patterns help us organize our thoughts across different programming and computing environments.
